# Exploratory Analysis of the Washington's Post Police Shooting dataset using R and Plotly

The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2016/) has been compiling a database of fatal shootings in the United States by police officers in the line of duty since January 1, 2015. The [dataset](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings) contains information like the date and the US state in which the killing occurred, the age, gender and, race of the deceased.

I performed exploratory analysis of the dataset using R and produced interactive graphics using [Plotly](https://plot.ly).
